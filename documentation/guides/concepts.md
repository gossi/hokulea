# Concepts

This page describes some re-occuring concepts being used in hokulea that are
also accessible for you.

## Builders

Hokulea supports the [builder
pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder) in a declarative
way. Either internally but also ready for you to construct components
the way you need them to be. That is why you see various `Builder` stories
throughout the documentation.
