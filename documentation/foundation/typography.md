# Typography

Hokulea supports typography in three flavors:

Prosa
: Prosa is used for 99% of the text, the one you are reading at the moment.

Headings
: Use for all headings (`h1` - `h4`) and provided utilities (`.t1` - `.t4`).

Display
: For emphasizing text in a special form.

Typography is only talking about _how_ it looks. Sizing (font size and line
height) is controlled through hokulea's [scaling system](./scale.md).

If you need more flavors than the ones provided by hokulea, feel free to add them to
your project. In that case the pattern used by hokulea to describe typography
might be a guideline to have a look into.

## Utilities

Utilities are available from `@hokulea/foundation/typography`:

_tbd_.

## Tokens

Most typography is controlled through design tokens. Have a look at the
typography section in the [theming](../guides/theming.md) guide.
